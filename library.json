  "description": "The ZH03B is a Laser Dust sensor module, small size sensor, that uses laser scattering principle to detect the dust particles in air, with good selectivity and stability. It is easy to use, with serial port output & PWM output. The module is software programmable through serial interface. This library features access to all module features though an abstracted class and methods to manage the module implemented in user-level functionality. The range of measured **PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10** values are all **0-1000ug/m3**.",
